## ðŸ”¥ Scrum Definition
**Scrum** is a lightweight framework that helps people, teams and organizations generate value through adaptive solutions for complex problems.

**Scrum** requires a **Scrum Master** to foster an environment where:

1. A Product Owner orders the work for a complex problem into a Product Backlog.
2. The Scrum Team turns a selection of the work into an Increment during a Sprint.
3. The Scrum Team and its stakeholders inspect the results and adjust for the next Sprint.
4. Repeat

## ðŸ”¥ Key changes in Scrum Guide 2020
- Scrum Team is the one team (no separate Dev Team within Scrum Team).
- Introduced Product Goal for Product Backlog, that aims to align Sprint Goal (Sprint backlog) and Definition of Done (Increment) with the Product Goal.
- Scrum team decides how to measure own progress towards the Sprint Goal (now Guide is less prescriptive about it).
- Three artifacts have corresponding commitments: Product Goal for Product Backlog, Sprint Goal for Sprint Backlog, DoD for Increment.
- Sprint Goal is more focused on bringing and communicating value to stakeholders

## ðŸ”¥ Scrum Theory
**Empiricism** (decisions are made on empiric knowledge) and **Lean thinking** (reduce waste + keep focus).

Scrum Team = Cross functional team (includes designers, QA, and others â€” not only Developers).

Scrum uses iterative, incremental approach to optimise predictability and to control risk.

Empirical Scrum pillars of

- **transparency** (via artifacts â€” Product Backlog, Sprint Backlog, Increment, transparency enables inspection),
- **inspection** (via regular **five events â€” sprint, sprint planning, daily scrums, sprint review, sprint retro**; inspection enables adaptation),
- **adaptation** (regular adjustments based on results and progress towards goals).

## ðŸ”¥ Scrum Values
- Commitment (to achieve goals)
- Focus (on the work of the Sprint)
- Openness (about the work and challenges)
- Respect (each other in team and others)
- Courage (to do right things and work with tough problems)

## ðŸ”¥ Scrum Team
1 Scrum Master, 1 Product Owner, and Developers (all other team members â€” not only developers) = up to 10 people.

If Scrum Teams become too large, they should consider reorganizing into multiple cohesive Scrum Teams, that share the same Product Goal, Product Backlog, and Product Owner.

### Developers
#### Accountable for:

- Creating a plan for the Sprint, the Sprint Backlog;
- Instilling quality by adhering to a Definition of Done;
- Adapting their plan each day toward the Sprint Goal; and,
- Holding each other accountable as professionals.

### Product Owner
#### Accountable for:

- maximizing the value of the product resulting from the work of the Scrum Team
- Developing and explicitly communicating the Product Goal;
- Creating and clearly communicating Product Backlog items;
- Ordering Product Backlog items; and,
- Ensuring that the Product Backlog is transparent, visible and understood.

Product Owner is one person, not a committee, and may represent the needs of many stakeholders in the Product Backlog. Product Owner may do the above work or may delegate the responsibility to others, remaining accountable.

### Scrum Master
#### Accountable for:

- Establishing Scrum as defined in the Scrum Guide via
- Scrum Teamâ€™s effectiveness via Scrum framework practises

#### Serves to Scrum Team:

- Coaching the team members in self-management and - cross-functionality;
- Helping the Scrum Team focus on creating high-value Increments with DoD;
- Causing the removal of impediments to the Scrum Teamâ€™s progress; and,
- Ensuring that all Scrum events take place in time and are productive.

#### Serves to PO:

Helping find techniques for effective Product Goal definition and Product Backlog management;
Helping the Scrum Team understand the need for clear and concise Product Backlog items;
Helping establish empirical product planning for a complex environment; and,
Facilitating stakeholder collaboration as requested or needed.
Serves to the organisation: Leading, training, and coaching, planning, advising on Scrum adoption and implementation, removing barriers between stakeholders and Scrum Teams.

## ðŸ”¥ Scrum events
### Sprint
Sprint is a container for all other events with **fixed length events of one month or less** to create consistency.

### During the Sprint:

- No changes are made that would endanger the Sprint Goal;
- Quality does not decrease;
- The Product Backlog is refined as needed; and,
- Scope may be clarified and renegotiated with the Product Owner as more is learned.

Only the Product Owner has the authority to cancel the Sprint if Sprint Goal becomes obsolete.

### Sprint planning
Sprint Planning addresses the following topics:

1. **Why is this Sprint valuable?** â€” PO proposes how product can increase value in the Sprint and whole Scrum Team collaborates to define a Sprint Goal that must be finalised during the Sprint Planning.
2. **What can be Done this Sprint?** â€” Developers select and refine items from Product Backlog for Sprint Backlog.
3. **How will the chosen work get done?** â€” Developers plan the work necessary to create an Increment that meets the Definition of Done for each selected PB item.
```
Sprint backlog = Sprint Goal + selected Product Backlog items + Dev plan
```

**Timebox = no more than 8 hours for 1 month Sprint.**

### Daily Scrum
Purpose of the Daily Scrum is to inspect progress toward the Sprint Goal and adapt the Sprint Backlog as necessary. Daily Scrum is not the only time Developers are allowed to adjust their plan â€” they can also meet any other time as necessary.

**Timebox: 15 minutes daily**

### Sprint review
Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the Sprint and determine future adaptations (present results to key Stakeholders).


**Timebox = no more than 4 hours for 1 month Sprint.**


### Sprint retrospective
Purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to increase quality and effectiveness: **what went well during the Sprint, what problems it encountered, and how those problems were (or were not) solved.**

**Timebox = no more than 3 hours for 1 month Sprint.**


## ðŸ”¥ Scrum Artifacts
1. Product Backlog with commitment = Product Goal
2. Sprint Backlog with commitment = Sprint Goal
3. Increment with commitment = Definition of Done

### Product Backlog
Product Backlog is an emergent, ordered list of what is needed to improve the product. It is the single source of work undertaken by the Scrum Team.

### Sprint Backlog
Sprint Backlog is composed of the Sprint Goal (why), the set of Product Backlog items selected for the Sprint (what), as well as an actionable plan for delivering the Increment (how).

### Increment
Each Increment is additive to all prior Increments and thoroughly verified, ensuring that all Increments work together. In order to provide value, the Increment must be usable. **Definition of Done** is a formal description of the state of the Increment when it meets the quality measures required for the product.
